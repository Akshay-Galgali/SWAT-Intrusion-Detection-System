# SWAT-Intrusion-Detection-System
IDS for motion based intrusion; Physical Security - SOC.

In this project, I have proposed a new security system: SWAT: Motion based Intrusion Detection System. Our research results show that SWAT is very promising for monitoring system. This system can be running 24/7 without compromising the security of the environment. And can notify the user whenever there is any motion happening in front of the sensor. The user will be notified with the images and videos of the intruder. So that the user can take required actions regarding the situation.
